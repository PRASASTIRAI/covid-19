                <h1>SYMPTOMS</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
     The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person
    coughs, sneezes, or exhales. 
     These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
     You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19,
    or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

           </center>
           <p>Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. 
            <br>Follow advice provided by your local health authority.
            To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
            <br>
            Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
            Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
            Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
            <br>
            Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
            Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
            Stay home if you feel unwell.

            <br>
            If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
            Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. 
            This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
            <br>
            Masks
            Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>

           <p>Scientists are working to understand several coronavirus variants now circulating in India, where a ferocious second wave of COVID-19 has devastated the nation and caught authorities unawares. The country recorded nearly 400,000 new infections on 9 May, taking its total to more than 22 million (see ‘Surging cases of COVID-19’).

            Evidence is growing that one variant first detected in India might be more transmissible and slightly better at evading immunity than existing variants. Animal models also hint that it might be able to cause more severe disease. Researchers want to know if this variant and others might be driving the second wave and what kind of danger they pose globally.
            
            In just a few weeks, the B.1.617 variant has become the dominant strain across India and has spread to about 40 nations, including the United Kingdom, Fiji and Singapore.
            
            A growing problem
            Two weeks ago, it looked as if multiple variants were behind a series of surges in India. Genomic data indicated that B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom, was dominant in Delhi and the state of Punjab, and a new variant dubbed B.1.618 was present in West Bengal. B.1.617 was dominant in Maharashtra.
            
            But since then, B.1.617 has overtaken B.1.618 in West Bengal, has become the leading variant in many states, and is increasing rapidly in Delhi. “In some states, the surge can be tied to 617,” Sujeet Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control, based in New Delhi, told journalists on 5 May.
